# RoR2 Unofficial Multiplayer Mods

This is mod aims mostly at the item sharing multiplayer mod
All the items (except lunar items and equipment) will be given to every living team member.
Only the host needs this mod for it to work

     I made this mod so that you could enjoy it with your friends with vanilla clients

**NOTE: 3D printers and crucibles will only remove the item from the person who activates it!**

**NOTE2: Please don't use this mod with public multiplayer match (like Quick Play)**

> As a developer of mods, we do this on purpose. **You're not supposed to be able to play online.** Hopoo (the devs or RoR2) **has specifically asked us not to interact with vanilla players for purely this reason**. **It ruins the online experience for other players.** It's possible to go online with mods but I have to strongly urge you to respect the dev's wishes and not. They are allowing us to mod and if enough of us are flooding multiplayer with mods they may just revoke that privilege.
